# Crank-Nicolson to price Stochastic Interest Rate Bonds and Derivatives
This repo contains the work I did to price a Bond following a stochastic interest rate by discretising a CIR++ PDE via Crank Nicolson. The work contains 2nd order boundary handling, the code is handled in an object-oriented manner. The results are discussed in my report.
